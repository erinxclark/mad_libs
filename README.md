# Mad-Libs

This was created as a JavaScript assignment at dev bootcamp.

Building it and having all the pieces work was challenging, but was helpful in understanding form submission and where the data goes once the button is clicked.

This page could be developed into a fun game that is more interesting to look at and more interactive. Changes we would make in the future include:

1. Styling with pictures, colors, fonts, etc.
2. Making the story longer and more complex. Using one input several times throughout the story (as in, the first name entered should be the main character and be repeated throughout without the user typing the name in more than once.)
3. Making a "choose your own adventure" style story, where the user gets to choose their action at a pivotal point in the story. This would take them into one of two (or more) potential scenarios.
